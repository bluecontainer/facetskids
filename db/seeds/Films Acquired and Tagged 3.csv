In Fall 2007, we gathered interviews from 25 mostly Asian and American students. Interviewees came from various disciplines including art and engineering. Every interviewee had at least one semester of cross-cultural and cross-disciplinary team experience. Five of these interviews were carefully selected and cast as Western and Eastern Superheroes-in-training. The team believes that through a light-hearted animation, audiences would be more receptive to the voices of our interviewees in our exploration of a deeply sensitive topic. The animation was created as a fourteen week project in Spring 2008 by five students of the Entertainment Technology Center, Carnegie Mellon University.|Animation, Nonfiction |Computer-Generated, Modern Times |Identity, Different Perspectives |Cultural Identity, Crosscultural ||||x|x|x|||Excited, Think |Make New Friends, Space to Think |||3
